# Website scraping

## Description:

This project is an example of web scraping. In this example, the data was taken from the website "www.autotrader.com"
with filters, which can be seen on this page:

> https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/all-cars/nissan/altima/rochester-ny-14626?dma=&searchRadius=0&location=&marketExtension=include&startYear=2013&endYear=2018&trimCodeList=ALTIMA%7C3.5%20SL&isNewSearch=true&showAccelerateBanner=false&sortBy=relevance&numRecords=25

In this directory you can find script file "get_data.py", which getting all the data, and "cars_info.csv", which
contains all the data received.  
In order for the data in the csv file to be displayed correctly, it is better to download the file and open it on your
computer. (I am using ";" as delimiter)
